# Colophon

The hosted documentation for Subversify is produced with Material for MkDocs.
MkDocs accepts different Markdown syntax to GitHub, so a small macro in
`docs/macros.py` is used to hide this formatting from GitHub using HTML comments
(`<!--: ... -->`). This is only really used in the `README.md`, which is also
the hosted home page. Other docs are standard Markdown.
