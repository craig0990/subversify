# @subversify/core

The `@subversify/core` contains the core functionality for Subversify:

* The `Module` class
* A `Global()` decorator and hook implementation
* A simply `AppFactory`
* And a work-in-progress `inspect()` function

If you are familiar with NestJS modules, they are largely similar, but adjusted
for Inversify's specific functionality.

If you are not familiar with NestJS modules, the [Modules](./modules.md) section
covers some of the basics.
